# Customer-Churn-Analysis

Problem Statement

A telecom company was experiencing a high customer churn rate and wanted to understand the key reasons behind customer attrition. The management needed clarity on which customer segments were most likely to churn, what services or contract types influenced churn behavior, and how churn was impacting overall revenue.

Objective
The objective of this project was to analyze customer data to understand the key factors contributing to churn and identify patterns that influence customer retention. The aim was to measure the overall churn rate, segment customers based on contract type, tenure, services, and monthly charges, and evaluate the revenue impact of churn. By uncovering high-risk customer groups and understanding their behavior, the goal was to provide meaningful, data-driven insights that can help the business design effective retention strategies and improve long-term customer value.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Business Insights

The analysis started with preparing and transforming the raw dataset using SQL. I cleaned the data by handling missing values, fixing inconsistencies, and standardizing categorical fields. I also created derived columns such as churn indicators and tenure groups to make the analysis more structured. To simplify reporting and improve performance, I built SQL views that aggregated important metrics like churn count, revenue, and customer segmentation. This ensured that the data loaded into Power BI was clean, consistent, and ready for business analysis.
After preparing the dataset, I first examined the overall churn distribution to calculate the percentage of customers who had discontinued the service. This helped establish a baseline churn rate and understand the magnitude of the problem. I then moved on to segmentation analysis, where churn rates were compared across different contract types such as month-to-month, one-year, and two-year contracts. This comparison clearly showed how contract duration influenced customer retention.Next, I conducted tenure-based analysis to understand how long customers stayed with the company before churning. By grouping customers into tenure ranges, I was able to identify that early-stage customers were more likely to leave compared to long-term customers. I also analyzed churn behavior across different service categories, including internet services, add-on features, and bundled packages. This helped determine whether customers subscribed to multiple services had stronger retention compared to those using limited services.
Pricing analysis was another important step, where I examined monthly charges and total revenue contribution. Customers were segmented based on billing amounts to understand whether higher charges were associated with increased churn probability. In addition, I evaluated the revenue impact of churn to estimate how much financial loss the company was facing due to customer attrition. I also reviewed demographic factors and payment methods to identify patterns in customer behavior that might be influencing churn decisions.Finally, all these insights were visualized in Power BI through interactive dashboards, where key KPIs such as churn rate, revenue loss, contract distribution, and service-level churn were tracked dynamically. This helped translate raw data into clear business insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several strategic actions can be taken to reduce churn and improve customer retention. Since customers with month-to-month contracts showed higher churn rates, the company can introduce incentives such as discounted long-term plans or loyalty benefits to encourage customers to shift to one-year or two-year contracts.As early-tenure customers were more likely to churn, implementing a strong onboarding and engagement strategy during the first few months can significantly reduce early attrition. Personalized welcome offers, proactive customer support, and regular engagement can improve customer satisfaction during this critical period.Customers with higher monthly charges also showed increased churn behavior. The company can consider offering customized plans, flexible pricing options, or value-added bundles to ensure customers feel they are receiving sufficient value for the price they pay.Since customers subscribed to multiple services demonstrated better retention, promoting bundled packages and cross-selling relevant services can increase customer stickiness. Bundled offerings can improve perceived value while also strengthening long-term engagement.Additionally, regular churn monitoring through dashboards and automated reporting can help the business proactively identify high-risk segments and take preventive action before customers decide to leave. A data-driven retention strategy focused on high-risk groups can significantly reduce revenue loss over time.
